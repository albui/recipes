Makes 12 cupcakes and one loaf
You Will Need
1 cup Brown Sugar
1 cup Vegetable Oil
3 Large Eggs
Pinch Salt
1/2 teaspoon Bicarb Soda
2 cups Self Raising Flour
2 cups finely grated Carrot (around 4 large carrots)
1/2 cup Walnuts, finely chopped
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
1 teaspoon Nutmeg
Cream Cheese Frosting
From Hummingbird Bakery Cookbook
300g Icing sugar
125g Cream Cheese, cold
50g Unsalted Butter, room temp

DIRECTIONS
Heat oven to 180 degrees celsius.
Beat sugar and oil until thick, then add 1 egg at a time and keep beating for a few more minutes.
Add salt, bicarb soda, carrots, flour, walnuts and spices.
Mix with wooden spoon until all combined.
Put batter in well greased loaf pan or tin and bake for 35-45 minutes (cake) or 15-20 minutes (cupcakes), or until light golden and cake springs back when touched in the middle. Baking time might vary depending on your personal oven.
Frosting
Beat the icing sugar and butter together with an electric mixer until well mixed.
Add the cream cheese in one go and beat until it is completely incorporated.
Turn the mixer up to medium high. Continue beating until the frosting is light and fluffy, at least 5 minutes. Do not overbeat, as it can quickly become runny.
